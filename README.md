# Ice Cream Surf Shop
## Overview
### Why Weather Analysis
I've finally found an investor for my dream Surf n' Shake shop. W. Avy is very concerned that this venture will turn out like his last surf shop--rained out of business. He's provided me with an Oahu weather dataset to anlyze and ensure we won't be rained out. He has specifically requested that I take a look at June and December's temperature data--to make sure that the Surf n' Shake shop will be viable year-round.
## Results
