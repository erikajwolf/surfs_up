# Ice Cream Surf Shop
## Overview
### Why Weather Analysis
I've finally found an investor for my dream Surf n' Shake shop. W. Avy is very concerned that this venture will turn out like his last surf shop--rained out of business. He's provided me with an Oahu weather dataset to anlyze and ensure we won't be rained out. He has specifically requested that I take a look at June and December's temperature data--to make sure that the Surf n' Shake shop will be viable year-round.
## Results
### June & December
**-The June and December mean temperatures aren't too far off: 74 degrees in June, 71 degrees in December**

**-The minimum temperature has a bigger spread: 64 degrees in June, 56 degrees in December**


## summary
Overall, it appears as though Oahu will have overall consistent temperatures to sustain a Surf n' Shake shop. Mean temperatures will be in the 70s, perfect for ice cream and time on the beach all year. While it will get a little colder in December, the max temperature will in the 80s throughout the year and will be perfect to pair ice cream after a tiring surfing session.
